             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: (2 marks) 
>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct' member,
>> global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.  
>> Identify the purpose of each in roughly 25 words.

>> A2: (4 marks) 
>> Draw a diagram that illustrates a nested donation in your structure and 
>> briefly explain how this works.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A3: (3 marks) 
>> How do you ensure that the highest priority waiting thread wakes up first for
>> a (i) lock, (ii) semaphore, or (iii) condition variable?

>> A4: (3 marks)
>> Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire() causes a 
>> priority donation. 
>> How is nested donation handled?

>> A5: (3 marks)
>> Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called on a lock that 
>> a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A6: (2 marks)
>> How do you avoid a race condition in thread_set_priority() when a thread 
>> needs to recompute its effective priority, but the donated priorities 
>> potentially change during the computation?
>> Can you use a lock to avoid the race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A7: (3 marks)
>> Why did you choose this design?  
>> In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?

              ADVANCED SCHEDULER
              ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: (2 marks)
>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct' member,
>> global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration. 
>> Identify the purpose of each in roughly 25 words.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: (3 marks)
>> Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2 and each has a 
>> recent_cpu value of 0. 
>> Fill in the table below showing the scheduling decision, the priority and the
>> recent_cpu values for each thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------
 0      0   1   2  63  61  59   A
 4      4   1   2  62  61  59   A
 8      8   1   2  61  61  59   B   round robin order
12      8   5   2  61  60  59   A
16     12   5   2  60  60  59   B  rro
20     12   9   2  60  59  59   A
24     16   9   2  59  59  59   C RRO
28     16   9   6  59  59  58   B
32     16   13  6  59  58  58   A
36     20   13  6  58  58  58   C

>> B3: (2 marks) 
>> Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values in the table 
>> uncertain?
>> If so, what rule did you use to resolve them?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B4: (3 marks)
>> Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in 
>> your design choices.
